1) EDA_file: EDA + strategy for feature engineering.
After first iteration through features, do t-SNE for mapping into 2d and check clusters as a part of feature engineering.

2) Preprocessing_file: Up/downsampling, Imputation, Scaling, new features.

3) ML_training_validation_test: Testing different classification models with different parameters (through cross-validation)
  and choice of the pest model (on test sample)

4) Production_file: Ethics questions. Training of glass-box model and comparison of performance with the best full model.
